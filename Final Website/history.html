          <h3 class="title">15th Century</h3>
          <p id=background1> Painting with oils became a common artistic practice. However, due to the heightened skill needed to best work with the oil paint, along with the harsh chemicals that served as additives within the paints, and the pungent cleaning solutions, artists desired an alternative artform.  </p>

          <h3 class="title">1934</h3>
          <p id=background2> The creation of acrylic resin and the adaptation of this substance into acrylic paint initiated the popularization of acrylic paint as a preferred substitute for oil based paint. </p>

          <h3 class="title">The Late 1930s</h3>
          <p id=background3> Mexican artist and political activist David Alfaro Siqueiros discovered the beauty of pour painting by accident. After examination of his unintentional wooden board masterpiece, he further studied the science behind the artistic medium and developed pour art. He loved the simplicity of the pour art process combined with the elaborate, stunning results. </p>

          <h3 class="title">The 1980s-2000s</h3>
          <p id=background4> As more attention was diverted toward scientific inquiry, studies into the viscocity of paint deepened. By recording the pouring of various paint colors on top of one another over a transparent surface, scientists found that the densities of the paints were responsible for different "floating" or "sinking" reactions, coined the "Rayleigh-Taylor instability". </p>
