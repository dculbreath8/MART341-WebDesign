While browsing the internet, the most common form I see appear on websites is a contact form, similar to the one I completed for this assignment. The contact form serves the purpose of providing accurate contact information for consumers to contact the business or individual owner of the website; and, sometimes, there is even a direct forum within the webpage to submit an inquiry without third party communication technology. Another form that is often present on webpages is the subscribe, or subscription, forms. These forms have a designated area on a webpage where visitors to the website can contribute their information (often phone number and email address) in order to be subscribed to insider, promotional sales, new products, etc. relating to the company.
