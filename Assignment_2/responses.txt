1. A directory serves as a nesting base for folders. Directory is specifically utilized when referring to the discussion/relationship of file systems.
2. Version Control System (VCS) serves as a memory system to see past changes made to code within previous versions of a section. In addition to tracking changes, a website designer or developer can revert to original drafts and easily collaborate or share original material.
3. My favorite artistic mediums for painting include acrylic paint (quick drying time, easily mixable, and bold colors) and watercolor (potential for layering effect, seamless blending, and "soft" appearance); also, I enjoy editing videos and studying the film theory behind the shots and techniques of movies.

The cold air is so refreshing, and the snow is absolutely beautiful.
It is like living in a snow globe!
